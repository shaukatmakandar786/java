# What is BPM (Business Process Management):
Business process management (BPM) is the practice of modeling, analyzing, and optimizing end-to-end business processes to help meet your strategic business goals, such as the improvement of your customer experience framework. BPM methodology can be applied to tasks and processes that are often repeated, ongoing, or predictable.

A business process is a set of activities that help a business reach a specific goal. Using BPM, you can evaluate your existing processes to find ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and errors, and support digital transformation efforts.
