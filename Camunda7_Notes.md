## What is BPM (Business Process Management):
Business process management (BPM) is the practice of modeling, analyzing, and optimizing end-to-end business processes to help meet your strategic business goals, such as the improvement of your customer experience framework. BPM methodology can be applied to tasks and processes that are often repeated, ongoing, or predictable.

A business process is a set of activities that help a business reach a specific goal. Using BPM, you can evaluate your existing processes to find ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and errors, and support digital transformation efforts.  

## What is BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation) :

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard way to represent business processes graphically using a flowchart. BPMN is used to model the steps of a business process from start to finish, including the flow of data, activities, and information.

BPMN is a key part of business process management (BPM). It's used by business owners and technical users to: Create consistent process documentation

## What is Camunda

Camunda is an open-source platform for business process automation, focusing on workflow and decision automation. It helps organizations model, automate, and optimize business processes. Camunda is widely used to orchestrate complex business workflows across multiple systems.

### Key Features of Camunda:
BPMN 2.0 Engine: Camunda supports BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), a widely-used standard for defining business processes visually, allowing process diagrams to be executed.

1. DMN Engine: The platform includes a Decision Model and Notation (DMN) engine to automate decision-making logic, allowing for rule-based decision automation.

2. CMMN Engine: It also supports Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) for case management scenarios where processes aren't strictly linear or predictable.

3. Spring Boot Integration: Camunda integrates easily with Spring Boot applications (like the one you mentioned youâ€™re using). This allows you to embed the process engine directly into your Spring-based applications.

4. Task Management and Monitoring: Camunda provides tools for managing tasks, monitoring processes in real-time, and handling human tasks within workflows.

5. REST API: It offers a REST API for interacting with workflows, making it easy to trigger processes and decisions programmatically.

6. Highly Scalable: Camunda is designed to handle complex, high-throughput business processes, making it scalable for large enterprise use cases.
